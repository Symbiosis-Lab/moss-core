//! Differential tests: assert that editor_scan() and extract_shortcodes()
//! agree on top-level block counts and names.
//!
//! `editor_scan` returns source byte positions for the CM6 editor. It
//! recognises ALL `:::name` openers including unknown/plugin names and
//! tracks nesting depth, but only emits top-level blocks.
//!
//! `extract_shortcodes` returns typed AST nodes for the build pipeline.
//! It only populates `ExtractionResult::extracted` for the six built-in
//! typed-known names (subscribe, buttons, gallery, hero, grid, recent).
//! Unknown names are rendered as `moss-unknown-shortcode` divs and do NOT
//! appear in `extracted`.
//!
//! Parity check: for input that uses only typed-known names, both parsers
//! must agree on the number of top-level blocks and their names.
//!
//! Note on the `hyphenated-names` fixture: the original spec used
//! `:::my-widget` (a hyphenated unknown name). `editor_scan` correctly
//! returns 1 block while `extract_shortcodes` returns 0 in `extracted`
//! — that is intentional, documented asymmetry. The fixture here uses
//! `:::gallery` instead to exercise the scanner on a standard block.
//! The `editor_scan` unit tests already cover hyphenated unknown names
//! (see `editor_scan::tests::shortcode_with_hyphenated_name`).
