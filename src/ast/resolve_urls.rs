//! Typed URL resolution: walk a [`Document`] and classify every
//! [`Url::Unresolved`] into a [`Url::Resolved`] with the right [`UrlKind`].
//!
//! One typed visitor replaces the two line-level "Stage 1" regex passes it was
//! migrated from (`markdown_refs` for bare-filename image refs,
//! `markdown_links` for standard `[text](url)` links), both deleted after
//! parity was proven — history in `docs/archive/2026-05-28-*`. Two properties
//! come from the AST rather than from code here: `Inline::Image::src` (always
//! an asset URL) is structurally distinct from `Inline::Link::url` (may be a
//! markdown target), and code is never visited by [`visit_urls_mut`], so no
//! fence tracking is needed.
//!
//! `resolve_link_urls` emits a `moss-resolved:<path>` sentinel and leaves the
//! URL `Url::Unresolved` so src-tauri's `classify_url_prod` can apply
//! `page_map` / `external_url_map` / wikilink-class-aware decoding. That
//! sentinel IS the moss-core ↔ src-tauri layering seam: moss-core resolves
//! filesystem paths, src-tauri owns the deployed URL space.
//!
//! ## OutgoingLink contract
//!
//! [`UrlResolution::outgoing`] carries the same load-bearing shape (target_path,
//! link_type, document-order sequence) the deleted passes produced. It uses
//! parsed inline text for `display_text` where they used the raw source between
//! `[` and `]`; `display_text` has no production consumer, so the divergence is
//! non-breaking (see `link_wrapping_image_target_path`).
