//! The P1 math fallback node and its inverse.
//!
//! P1's contract is that math is **never silently deleted**. Two shapes
//! carry an equation through the AST, and this module owns both plus the
//! conversion between them, so the format and its parser cannot drift:
//!
//! | Shape | Built by | Used where |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `<code class="moss-math" data-moss-math="…">` in [`Inline::Other`] | [`math_inline`] | rendered HTML |
//! | `$…$` / `$$…$$` markdown source | [`math_source`] | every plain-text collector |
//!
//! **Why plain-text collectors get the source and not bare TeX.** pulldown
//! hands a walker the *inner* TeX only — delimiters stripped, inner bytes
//! otherwise untouched — so `$` + tex + `$` reproduces the author's
//! original bytes exactly. Restoring the delimiters is what keeps three
//! independent surfaces in agreement:
//!
//! 1. **The math=off slug.** `# Euler $e^{i\pi}=-1$ identity` must produce
//!    the same `<h1 id>` whether or not `[site].math` is on, or flipping
//!    the flag silently breaks every existing deep link, in-page TOC entry
//!    and `[[Page#Heading]]` wikilink pointing at that heading.
//! 2. **The wikilink graph.** `build/scan/scan.rs` slugs headings off the
//!    RAW heading line; being a line scanner it cannot know where math
//!    begins, so it always includes the `$` bytes. The render side has to
//!    match it, or the graph resolves a link to a fragment the page lacks.
//! 3. **`heading::extract`**, whose module doc calls byte-identity with the
//!    rendered `<hN id>` "the keystone invariant".
//!
//! Bare TeX would satisfy none of the three. Markup would be actively wrong
//! in these contexts — `alt` is an HTML attribute and the slug feeds a URL
//! fragment.

/// Build the P1 math fallback node: the equation's own markdown source —

///
/// The `data-moss-math` attribute carries display-vs-inline so a later
/// phase's renderer can typeset from the AST without re-deriving it, and so
/// the CSS can size display math differently without a second class.
///
/// **Why the `$` delimiters are kept.** P1 ships no typesetting engine, so
/// this span is what the reader actually sees. Emitting the bare inner TeX
/// would silently swallow two characters of the author's prose, which is the
/// same content-loss P1 exists to prevent — just moved from "equation
/// deleted" to "delimiters deleted". It is invisible for a real equation and
/// destructive for a false positive:
///
/// ```text
/// 一个$5，两个$10     bare TeX → 一个5，两个10      (prices corrupted)
///                     source   → 一个$5，两个$10    (byte-identical)
/// ```
///
/// pulldown's close rule fires on any non-whitespace byte, so unspaced CJK
/// currency parses as math (`moss doctor --math` exists to surface exactly
/// this), and `[site].math` defaults on — the false positive is the case to
/// optimize for. Keeping the delimiters also makes this node agree with
/// [`math_source`], so an equation has ONE spelling across the body, image
/// alt text, heading slugs and meta descriptions instead of two.
///
/// P2/P3 replace this span with typeset SVG, at which point the delimiters
/// disappear along with the fallback.
