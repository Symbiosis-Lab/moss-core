//! One string somebody outside moss wrote, made safe to draw and to say.
//!
//! Plugins and the registry supply names, labels, descriptions and reasons
//! that moss renders inside sentences of its own — "Enter your credentials for
//! X", "X was withdrawn: <reason>". Two properties have to hold before any of
//! them reaches a screen or a screen reader, and they are not the renderer's
//! to decide:
//!
//! - **No invisible direction control.** A `U+202E` inside a name does not
//!   reverse the name, it reverses the sentence moss wrote around it, so a
//!   plugin can make moss appear to say something moss did not say.
//! - **A bound.** Length is the author's to choose and moss's to limit; a grid
//!   lays tiles out from the text they carry, and `aria-label` has no layout to
//!   push back.
//!
//! It lives here, in the crate with no I/O, on the expectation that two sides
//! need it: the registry client in `src-tauri`, which calls it today, and the
//! plugin contribution parser in `moss-build`, which does not yet exist.
//! Until that second caller lands this placement is a bet, not a fact — if it
//! is still the only caller when the registry work finishes, this belongs in
//! `src-tauri/src/plugins/` and the `children_per_dir` waiver that paid for it
//! should be reverted.
