//! Theming escape hatches — Source 2b of the federated contract.
//!
//! Two tables that do not fit the class-keyed [`super::components::COMPONENTS`]
//! table, kept here rather than bolted onto it.
//!
//! Why they are separate: 167 component entries would each need an empty array
//! that says nothing, and several of these hooks have no single owning class at
//! all — `--moss-nav-width` resolves against the `<body>`-level content width,
//! `--moss-escape` is set by `[data-width]` on any block, and `data-page` lives
//! on `<body>`, which carries no `moss-*` class. Inventing a `moss-body` entry
//! to give it a home would have added an orphan contract entry for a class moss
//! never emits — precisely what teaches agents to target dead selectors (#777).
//!
//! ## Adding a hook
//!
//! 1. Read it from a stylesheet as `var(--moss-foo, <fallback>)`.
//! 2. Add a [`CustomProp`] here, with `default` copied **verbatim** from the
//!    call site. A declared hook with an invented default is worse than an
//!    undeclared one: an agent reasons from the wrong starting point and has no
//!    way to tell.
//! 3. `cargo test --test components_sync_test` — `every_escape_hatch_is_declared`
//!    fails on a read nothing declares, and `every_declared_custom_prop_is_read`
//!    fails on a declaration nothing reads.

/// A CSS custom property a theme may set to reconfigure a component.

/// These are read by moss's stylesheets as `var(--moss-foo, <fallback>)` and
/// are deliberately **never declared** — that is exactly what makes them opt-in
/// escape hatches rather than design tokens. A token has a value in `:root` and
/// cascades site-wide; one of these has no value until a theme sets it, and it
/// is set *on a component or a scope* to change that component.
///
/// The distinction matters because it is the whole theming API in practice.
/// Audited 2026-08-03: the two most heavily customized moss sites (okagaki, 在場)

/// okagaki hand-fought the hero height caps that `--moss-hero-max-height` exists
/// to lift, across three selectors and a 12-line comment.
