//! Pure URL/path transform helpers — no filesystem access, no env lookups.
//! Used by moss-core's render functions (see crate::render::*) and by
//! upstream src-tauri call sites.
//!
//! # Design Intent
//!
//! Every component that derives an output path from a video or image source
//! path (e.g., .mov → .mp4, .mov → .thumb.jpg, .jpg → .webp) MUST use these
//! functions. This ensures consistency between:
//! - HTML attributes set by the synthesizers (src, data-placeholder-src, poster)
//! - AssetReady event paths emitted by the build pipeline
//! - AssetRegistry keys used by the preview server
//! - iframe-bridge.ts path comparisons
//!
//! If naming conventions change, they change here only.
//!
//! These are pure string functions — no I/O, no filesystem access.
//! They work on both root-relative paths ("videos/clip.mov") and
//! document-relative paths ("../clip.mov").

/// 2. **registration** — blocking.rs's rung loop promises each rung URL via
///    `set_source_passthrough` + `set_pending`;
/// 3. **encode** — `encode_rungs` (build/media/rungs.rs, extracted from image.rs
///    at Task 10.5) derives the same ladder from oriented dims on the
///    full-encode and warm-cache paths; `convert_single_image`'s `ladder_len`
///    (build/media/image.rs) reads the same call to keep the oriented original
///    alive for the rung re-encode;
/// 4. **dispatch/sweep/Err-arm retraction** — the worker success/failure
///    arms' `registered_rungs` reconstruction (build/media/image.rs)
///    resolves or retracts every promise registration made;
/// 5. **fingerprint-skip heal** — the unchanged-fingerprint pass
///    (`dispatch_image_conversions`, build/media/image.rs) rematerializes each
///    rung it recomputes here.
///
/// One further `ladder_rungs(` caller is NOT a set-agreement member:
/// `should_skip`'s AlreadySmall carve-out (build/media/image.rs) consults only
/// `ladder_rungs(..).is_empty()` — a "carries any rung?" boolean that keeps a
/// small rung-bearing webp from skipping re-encode — so it never emits,
/// registers, encodes, or sweeps a rung SET and cannot disagree on membership.
///
/// A rung is emitted in HTML iff it is registered iff it is encoded. Never
/// add an input here that one of these sites cannot supply (e.g. encode
/// outcomes, cache state) — that is the parallel-oracle bug class deleted
/// 2026-05-20 (see build/media/image.rs:297-310).
///
/// EXIF-ORIENTATION AGREEMENT (canonical; the pipeline sites back-reference
/// here). The "same scan-derived dims on every site" premise holds
/// UNCONDITIONALLY — including an EXIF-oriented (orientation 5-8, i.e. a 90°/270°
/// rotation) png/webp/jpeg. Scan's `extract_image_dimensions` (build/scan/
/// scan.rs) swaps `w`×`h` for orientation 5-8 on EVERY ladder source, reading
/// orientation through the SAME `read_exif_orientation` the encode side's
/// `decode_oriented` uses — so the dims scan feeds emission/registration/sweep/
/// heal equal encode's oriented dims byte-for-byte and the two ladders cannot
/// diverge. (Before the 2026-07-23 scan-swap fix — design follow-up #1 — scan's
/// orientation read was JPEG-GATED, so an EXIF-rotated png/webp stored the
/// UNswapped header dims and could strand an emitted-but-never-encoded rung →
/// publish-404, preview degrading to the placeholder via the unresolved-promise
/// sweep.) Do NOT re-gate scan's swap to jpeg-only, and do NOT "fix" any future
/// divergence by narrowing the encode side: the encoder strips EXIF, so a base
/// that isn't oriented at encode time ships stored sideways (visibly rotated).
///
/// Rungs are strictly below the deployed base WIDTH (post-resize, see
/// [`deployed_width`] — portrait sources have a smaller base width than
/// `min(w, DEPLOY_MAX_EDGE)`) so the base descriptor never duplicates a
/// rung and no rung is ever wider than the base. Animated sources get no
/// ladder (animation-preserving multi-size re-encode is out of scope).
///
/// APNG: an animated PNG passes `is_raster_original` like any png, and the
/// BASE webp encode already FLATTENS it to a still today (`should_skip` in
/// build/media/image.rs sniffs animation only for gif/webp). Rungs run
/// through the same encode path and inherit the same flattening —
/// consistent by construction, no 404 risk.
///
/// ANIMATED-FLAG AGREEMENT (Phase B, Task 12). Only ONE of the five sites
/// passes a non-`false` flag: **emission** passes the scan-derived
/// `assets.is_animated(src)` for webp sources (an animated webp → empty
/// ladder → bare `<img>`, no srcset). The four pipeline sites (registration,
/// `rungs_gated`/`ladder_len`, `registered_rungs`, fingerprint-heal, plus
/// `encode_rungs`) keep the `false` literal, and that literal is PROVABLY
/// correct — not an assumption: an animated webp returns
/// `SkipReason::AnimatedWebp` in `should_skip`, so `collect_images_for_
/// conversion` drops it BEFORE it can become an `ImageConversionItem`. Every
/// webp that reaches the pipeline is therefore non-animated, and `false`
/// equals its real flag. Because scan's `sniff_is_animated` and `should_skip`
/// both call the SAME `is_animated_webp`, the emission verdict and the
/// pipeline's inclusion verdict never disagree: an animated webp is
/// simultaneously flagged in the snapshot (emission → no rungs) AND filtered
/// from the item list (pipeline → no rungs). Both sides produce zero rungs.
/// png/jpg/jpeg are never animated through this path (animated gif/webp are
/// not in the conversion set) and keep `false` everywhere too.
